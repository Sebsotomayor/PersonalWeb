        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p> As part of an assignment for Computer Science 1, this project involved an experimental study
             of six sorting algorithmsâ€”Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Merge-Insertion Sort,
              and Quick Sort. The purpose of the experiment was to compare the execution times of these algorithms and
               understand how their performance scales with increasing data sizes.
               
            Implemented in C, the program generates random datasets, measures the execution time of each algorithm,
             and records the results. The findings are then visualized in an Excel-based plot,
              illustrating the relationship between data size, algorithm complexity, and execution time.
               This project highlights my skills in algorithm analysis, performance evaluation, and data visualization.</p>

            <h3>Methodology:</h3>
            <p>
                Arrays of predetermined sizes were initialized with 
                random integers using a random number generator. 
                To ensure fair comparisons, the original array was 
                copied into a temporary array before each sorting 
                algorithm was applied. This approach guaranteed 
                identical initial conditions for all algorithms. 
                Each algorithm was then executed on the temporary 
                array, and its execution time was recorded. 
                The data was systematically stored and later 
                exported to Excel for visualization. Using Excel, 
                 the execution times were plotted against array 
                sizes to analyze performance trends and 
                highlight differences in efficiency among 
                the algorithms.

            <h3>Observations:</h3>
            <p>
                Bubble Sort displayed consistently poor 
                performance, confirming its inefficiency 
                for large datasets. Selection Sort, while 
                slightly faster than Bubble Sort, remained 
                impractical for large-scale applications due 
                to its  complexity. Insertion Sort performed 
                well for smaller datasets but exhibited slower 
                execution times as array sizes increased. 
                Merge Sort and Quick Sort both excelled with 
                large datasets, reflecting their  complexity 
                and efficiency. Merge-Insertion Sort proved 
                to be a versatile algorithm, effectively 
                leveraging Merge Sort for larger arrays while 
                utilizing Insertion Sort for smaller subarrays
                 to optimize overall performance.

                Conclusion:
            </h3>

            <p>
                This project effectively demonstrated the varying efficiencies 
                of sorting algorithms and validated theoretical predictions about
                 their time complexities. Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and the hybrid
                  Merge-Insertion Sort emerged as the most efficient algorithms 
                  for handling large datasets. Conversely, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, 
                  and Insertion Sort were more suitable for smaller datasets or 
                  educational purposes. The project highlighted the critical role 
                  of algorithm selection in optimizing performance and underscored 
                  the importance of understanding computational time complexity in 
                  real-world applications.
