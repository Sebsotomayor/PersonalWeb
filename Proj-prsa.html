            <h3>PRSA's Mission Statement:</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of PRSA is to unite the Puerto Rican students at UCF and
                 to help and support each other throughout the educational journey.
                  PRSA stands for opportunity. The organization helps its members
                   excel at UCF by providing them with proper leadership and personal
                    growth experiences. PRSA will offer a safe, comfortable and
                     judgement free environment for Puerto Rican students to come
                      together and smoothly adjust to the campus life. Discussions
                       about personal experiences and cultural diversity will serve
                        as the primary source for developing harmony and friendship
                         among all of its members and the rest of the UCF student body.
                          PRSA, as the acting Puerto Rican institution at UCF, will look
                           after the educational and social development and progress of
                            the Puerto Rican community in Orlando and Central Florida.

                <h3>My Role:</h3>
               <p>As Marketing Director for the Puerto Rican Student Association at UCF,
                 I led targeted social media campaigns to promote cultural events 
                 and foster a sense of community for Puerto Rican students. 
                 By managing Instagram and creating engaging content, 
                 I successfully increased our online following by 200 
                 new members while driving awareness for our initiatives. 
                 Additionally, I built partnerships with media outlets and 
                 other Latin student organizations, enhancing the visibility 
                 of our events and strengthening connections across the campus 
                 community. Through these efforts, I helped create an environment 
                 where students could connect, celebrate their culture, and feel at home.</p>
